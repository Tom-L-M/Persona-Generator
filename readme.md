# PERSONA-GENERATOR JS

A very simple tool for creating personas. 

Just download the proper zipped binary from /resources, extract, and execute it. 
You will be prompted with some basic questions as creation guidelines.
Respond the ones you want, and leave the ones you don't, to be randomized.

Finally, select a file to save the generated data, and 'voil√°': your new 'persona' is ready.

A very simple tool for creating personas. 

Just download the proper binary from /resources, and execute it. 
You will be prompted with some basic questions as creation guidelines.
Respond the ones you want, and leav the ones you don't to be randomized.

Finally, select a file to save the generated data, and 'voil√°': your new 'persona' is ready.
